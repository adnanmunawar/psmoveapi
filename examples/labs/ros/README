This application expects that the PS Move API has been
build in "build/" in the root source folder.

After you have built the PS Move API in this way, source ROS 1
and create a local build folder (e.g. ros/build/). In the build
 folder, type `cmake ..`and then `make`

Additional requirements:
  ROS 1 (tested with ROS Noetic)
